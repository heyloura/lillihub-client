# Lillihub - An unofficial Micro.Blog web client
Lillihub is a simple, lightweight micro.blog web client with a light/dark mode and responsive design. It is built using [Deno](https://deno.com/), HTML, CSS, and a sprinkle of vanilla JavaScript. It is delightfully usable without JavaScript being enabled. Everything is saved locally to the client so no backend storage is used.

The goal of this project was to make a web app that covered common use cases of Micro.Blog. With this app you can:
    
- Browse your timeline feed
- View user profiles
- Comment on posts
- Create and manage blog posts
- Upload images and manage your blog media
- Follow/Block/Mute users
- Manage your Micro.Blog bookshelves
- Manage your Micro.Blog bookmarks
- Keep track of emoji tags, discover feed, and official Micro.Blog accounts easier

I hope people enjoy using the app as much as I did building it ‚ù§Ô∏èüê∏

# Running Locally
You will need to have [Deno](https://deno.com/) installed and available on your `$PATH`. Then run the command `deno run --allow-env --allow-net --allow-read  main.js`. This will run the webserver on your `localhost`. There is no build step.

You will also need an `.env` file with the `APP_URL` pointing to your `localhost`. In my case it was
`localhost:8080`

Once the application is running you will need to sign in and authenticate with Micro.Blog. If you have your `localhost` configured with a SSL certificate you should be all set to login using the login button.
Otherwise you will need edit the URL that Micro.Blog returns to `http://` and not `https://`.

*Note:* You many need to allow the connection to micro.blog in your terminal

# Deploying to Deno Deploy with the Github Integration
Clone the repository and then create an account on [Deno Deploy](https://deno.com/deploy) and from the Deno Deploy dashboard, 
click the "New Project" button and choose the option to "Select a repository". Follow the on-screen instructions to deploy your existing application.

You will then need to set the environmental variable `APP_URL` by going to the settings tab and adding it to the environmental variable section.
Deno deploy offers all projects a `.deno.dev` domain. You can copy and paste that domain as the `APP_URL` if you are not
using a custom one.

# FAQ

## Why are you loading in the CSS/JavaScript and serving it with the page?
This is to keep the number of requests being called to Deno Deploy low since there is request limit on the free plan. This could also be resolved by hosting the resources on a CDN. 

## Why does it take forever for the DOMContentLoaded event?
This app streams HTML to the client while it is processing the API calls to Micro.Blog. While the stream is open the event won't fire even though DOM content is available and interactive on the client.
